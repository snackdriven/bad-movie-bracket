# Worst Movie Tournament

You are going to sit down, open this bracket, and be forced to decide whether *Cats* is worse than *Catwoman*. In writing. With your name on it.

There is no good answer. There is only the answer you can live with.

## What is this

32 movies. One question, repeated 31 times: which of these is worse.

Not bad in a boring way. Bad in a *Tommy Wiseau spent $6 million importing Korean leather jackets* way. Bad in a *Joel Schumacher apologized for the Batsuit nipples separately from apologizing for the whole movie* way. These films were made by real humans with real budgets and at no point did anyone in the room say "wait."

Pick the worst in each matchup. Keep going until one film stands alone as the undisputed champion of failure. It will feel like a victory for it. It shouldn't.

## The quadrants

| | Quadrant | Vibe |
|---|---|---|
| 💀 | **Passionate Disasters** | Made with alarming sincerity. Nobody told them. Nobody. |
| 🗑️ | **Celebrity Shame** | A-listers who have since asked us, nicely, to move on |
| 🎬 | **Comedy Graveyard** | So unfunny it becomes a different kind of art |
| 🔥 | **How Did This Get Made** | The studio system failed. Catastrophically. |
